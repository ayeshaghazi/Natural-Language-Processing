I need the software to type proficiently due to disability, and it will not install. The download itself seems to be a corrupted file, I have a fair amount of computer skills and no amount of tinkering has made the program work, so, judging by other reviews, it must be the program itself.   \n",

              "7  This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.\\n\\nHowever, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with \"Colloquial Icelandic\" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- \"Hva\" is pronounced \"kwah?\" WHAT? Having \"Colluquial Icelandic\" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.\\n\\nI gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course.   \n",

I purchased this with \"Colloquial Icelandic\" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- \"Hva\" is pronounced \"kwah?\" WHAT? Having \"Colluquial Icelandic\" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal.

I have wasted over 5 to 7 hours attempting to capture `VHS clips to make a DVD. Each time when I went to save the clips, I got a message that stated \" VHS to DVD has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working.  Windows is searching for a solution....\"  FYI, the Customer Service Tech was courteous, but his recommendations were to no avail in my finding a solution.  I have Windows 7 Home...  Perhaps something in my system is interfering, but after copiously following their instructions, nothing worked.  The program may load for you, but I would caution you buying this product.   \n",

I love using the Mac for numerous reasons but most of the legal applications I use are Windows based only.  Parallels works great.\\nI recommend that you NOT partition the Mac for Windows....you won't use the partition and so it is a waste of space.  And when I initially had problems setting it up...they were extremely helpful.  Now, that I know the system, when I upgrade, I do not have to call them for help.  The product is great.  I prefer to not use the coherence mode but actually have a windows desktop on my mac...just a personal preference.  I share certain drives so that if I save a PDF on the Windows side, I can easily open it on the Mac side.   \n",

Overall I would recommend this software to future educators and parents.   \n",

Works ok for about the first month or so and then...WHAMMMM..crash city. Think I'm joking...buy it and find out for yourself.

            "580  i had no intention of using this product; like others, i just got it as part of a bundle that gave me a substantial rebate. since so many other people have written about their problems actually getting the rebate, i figured i should chime in with my experience. if you follow the direction precisely you will get your rebate. just don't ever actually install the software. and put a reminder on your calendar to go and cancel your automatic subscription renewal. their rebate tracking is actually pretty good. it took about two weeks from when i sent it (snail mail) to when their system said they received it. then it took another two weeks for them to approve it. when i filed the rebate i opted for the expedited version which cost me 10% of the rebate (deducted directly from the rebate-no money up front). after approval, they mailed it within four days and a received it a couple of days later. It comes in a completely nondescript envelope so it's easy to miss. But it's a real, live AmEX prepaid gift card. I used it last night in fact. And today I remembered to go cancel my automatic renewal service. Contrary to what some others have said, it took on the first time and wasn't a big deal. I used a throw away email address when I signed up (though I haven't received any email from them since) so it took me longer to figure out what my username was to sign in than it did for me to actually cancel.   \n",

              "7  This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.\\n\\nHowever, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with \"Colloquial Icelandic\" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- \"Hva\" is pronounced \"kwah?\" WHAT? Having \"Colluquial Icelandic\" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.\\n\\nI gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course.   \n",
