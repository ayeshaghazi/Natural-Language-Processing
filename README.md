# Natural Language Processing Projects

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) repository! This repository contains a collection of NLP projects that I have worked on, ranging from basic text preprocessing to advanced models and applications. These projects aim to showcase my skills and explore various NLP techniques used in real-world applications.

## Projects

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: A project focused on analyzing and classifying sentiments from textual data, using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
   
2. **Text Classification**: This project involves categorizing text data into predefined categories using algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and deep learning models.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: A project where I extracted and categorized named entities such as person names, locations, and organizations from unstructured text.

4. **Topic Modeling**: A deep dive into unsupervised learning techniques to uncover hidden topics in large collections of text.

5. **Text Generation with GPT-2**: An exploration of how generative models like GPT-2 can be used for text generation tasks.

6. **Chatbot Implementation**: A simple conversational AI model using rule-based or machine learning approaches.
